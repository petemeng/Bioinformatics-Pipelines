# Bioinformatics Pipelines Collection

A curated collection of bioinformatics pipelines for various omics data analysis. This repository is designed to be a practical and educational resource for researchers and students in the life sciences.

## 📖 Introduction

Welcome! The goal of this project is to provide clear, well-documented, and easy-to-use pipelines for common bioinformatics tasks. Each pipeline is organized logically and includes example data to help you get started quickly.

Whether you are a beginner looking to learn or an experienced bioinformatician seeking a standardized workflow, you'll find valuable resources here.

## 🚀 Available Pipelines

Here is a directory of the analysis pipelines currently available in this repository. Each pipeline has its own detailed documentation.

| Pipeline Category | Analysis Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Microbiome** | [16S rRNA Analysis](./16s_rRNA_analysis/) | From raw sequencing data to diversity analysis and taxonomic classification for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. |
| **Metagenomics** | [Shotgun Metagenomics](./metagenomics/) | *(Coming Soon)* Analysis of shotgun metagenomic data, including assembly, binning, and functional annotation. |
| **Transcriptomics**| [RNA-seq Analysis](./transcriptomics/) | *(Coming Soon)* Differential gene expression analysis from RNA-seq data. |
| **Single-Cell** | [scRNA-seq Analysis](./single_cell_omics/) | *(Coming Soon)* Clustering, cell type identification, and trajectory analysis for single-cell RNA-seq data. |

## 🔧 Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://your-repository-url/Bioinformatics-Pipelines.git
    cd Bioinformatics-Pipelines
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a pipeline:**
    Choose a pipeline you are interested in from the table above and navigate to its directory.
    ```bash
    cd 16s_rRNA_analysis
    ```
3.  **Follow the instructions:**
    Each pipeline directory contains a detailed `README.md` file with specific instructions on dependencies, setup, and usage.

## 🧪 Test Data

Each pipeline directory contains a `data/` subdirectory for test datasets. This allows you to run and verify each pipeline independently. Please refer to the specific pipeline's `README.md` for details on its test data.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a pipeline you'd like to add or an improvement to an existing one, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
