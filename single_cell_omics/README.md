# Single-Cell Omics Analysis Pipeline

*(Coming Soon)*

This directory will contain scripts and documentation for the analysis of single-cell sequencing data, primarily focusing on scRNA-seq.

## Planned Workflow

*   **Upstream Analysis**:
    *   Processing raw sequencing data into a count matrix (e.g., using Cell Ranger).
*   **Downstream Analysis**:
    *   Quality control and filtering of cells.
    *   Normalization and scaling.
    *   Dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP, t-SNE).
    *   Cell clustering and marker gene identification.
    *   Cell type annotation.
    *   Trajectory inference (optional).
