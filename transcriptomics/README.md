# Transcriptomics (RNA-seq) Analysis Pipeline

*(Coming Soon)*

This directory will contain scripts and documentation for differential gene expression analysis from RNA-seq data.

## Planned Workflow

*   **Upstream Analysis**:
    *   Quality Control (QC) of raw reads.
    *   Alignment to a reference genome (e.g., using STAR, HISAT2).
    *   Read quantification (e.g., using featureCounts, Salmon).
*   **Downstream Analysis**:
    *   Differential expression analysis (e.g., using DESeq2, edgeR).
    *   Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).
    *   Data visualization (e.g., heatmaps, volcano plots).
